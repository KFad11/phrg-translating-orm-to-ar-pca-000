###Objectives:
1. Understand how ActiveRecord abstracts powerful methods for you.
2. Identify how to inherit your models.

This lab is meant to show you the power of `ActiveRecord`. Take a look at your test suite in `spec/dog_spec.rb` Right now there are eight tests that are all failing. In the past you had to write out each method individually to pass each test. Now with ActiveRecord, the hard work is done for you! Run your tests and watch them fail. Then make sure your `Dog` class inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` and watch them pass!
